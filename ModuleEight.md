# `Module 8 - Pricing and Support`

## `8.1 AWS Free Tier`

- [`AWS Free Tier`](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) - enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period.
- #### `Always free`
  - Do not expire and are available to all AWS customers.
  - `Example`: AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month. Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month.
- #### `12 months free`
  - Free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS.
  - `Example`: include specific amounts of Amazon S3 Standard Storage, thresholds for monthly hours of Amazon EC2 compute time, and amounts of Amazon CloudFront data transfer out.
- #### `Trials`
  - Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.
  - `Example`: Amazon Inspector offers a 90-day free trial. Amazon Lightsail (service to run virtual private servers) offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period.

## `8.2 AWS Pricing Concepts`

- ### `How AWS Pricing Works`
  - #### `Pay for what you use`
    - Pay for exactly the amount of resources for each service.
    - Without long-term contracts or complex licensing.
  - #### `Pay less when you reserve`
    - Some service offers reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.
  - #### `Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more`
    - Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.
- ### `AWS Pricing Calculator`

  - [`AWS Pricing Calculator`](https://calculator.aws/#/)
    ```
    - Estimate the cost of your use cases on AWS.
    - organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define.
    - Once an estimate has been created, you can save it and generate a link to share with others.
    ```
