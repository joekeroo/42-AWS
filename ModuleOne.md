# `Module 1 - Introduction to Amazon Web Services`

## `client-server model`

- `client` can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer server.
- `server` can be services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) â€“ a type of virtual server.
- When a `client` makes a request, the `server` will evaluate the details of the request and fulfills it by returning the information to the `client`.

## `Cloud Computing`

- The `on-demand delivery` of IT resources over the internet with `pay-as-you-go` pricing.
- `on-demand delivery` indicates that AWS has the resource you need, when you need them.
- 3 cloud computing deployment models are `cloud-based`, `on-premises`, and `hybrid`.
- ### `cloud-based deployment`
  - Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
  - Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
  - Design and build new applications in the cloud.
  - For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud.
- ### `on-premise deployment (private cloud deployment)`
  - Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
  - Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
  - For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your `on-premises` data center. Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization.
- ### `hybrid deployment`
  - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
  - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.
  - For example, suppose that a company wants to use cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics. However, the company has several legacy applications that are more suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud. With a `hybrid deployment`, the company would be able to keep the legacy applications on premises while benefiting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud.
- ### `Benefits of Cloud Computing`

  - trade upfront expense for variable expense.
  - stop spending money to run and maintain data centers.
  - stop guessing capacity.
  - benefit form massive economies of scale.
  - increase speed and agility.
  - go global in minutes.
